Mark Webber qualified fifth, which was his worst result since the first race of the season in Bahrain, where he started sixth. At the start, Vettel maintained the lead, Button passed Alonso, who started third. Mark Webber had a less than ideal start in the race and soon began to lose pace due to significant tire wear. Red Bull had to call Mark into the pits on the 12th lap, and the driver returned to the track in 16th place.</p>
